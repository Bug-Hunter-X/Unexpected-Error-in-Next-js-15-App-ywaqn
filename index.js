```javascript
// pages/index.js

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my Next.js app</h1>
      <p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

This simple Next.js app might encounter an unexpected error if the `pages/` directory structure is incorrectly set up or there are issues with the file naming conventions.  For example, a missing `pages` directory would cause an error. Another common mistake is incorrect file naming (e.g., `index.jsx` instead of `index.js` if you're not using JSX).  Less common errors include issues with dynamic imports and unexpected behavior with edge functions if those are used in the application.
